# Working on Code in Development
  You will need to run two different servers, one for the backend and one for the frontend. This means you will have to have two terminal instances open at the same time.
  1. Get both the frontend repo and backend repo from github
  2. Run npm install for both front and back end folders (make sure you have all the files)
  2. Open up a terminal instance dedicated to the frontend, run npm start -> this will open up localhost:3000/ where you can find index.html
  4. Open up a terminal instance for the backend, run npm start -> this will open up the api on localhost:5000 where you have backend data
  You can now fetch requests from the frontend to the backend, ONLY when both terminals are running
